	<h1>GitHub Reactive Api</h1>
	<p>REST API that gives you basic information about GitHub accounts</p>
</div>

## Introduction
This project served as a way for me to play with reactive programming a bit. Code isn't perfect since im new to WebFlux. Don't rely on it too much ðŸ˜…

## Installation
For this project to work you will need:
- Your favourite IDE,
- API platform e.g. Postman

Now you can run project in few simple steps:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/MemeeMaster/github-reactive-api
$ cd github-reactive-api
```
Open project with your IDE and run it.

## Usage / How it works
This project will give you basic information about GitHub account specified in request body. By sending request you will retrieve:
- User login,
- User repositories which are not forks,
- Repository branches

**How it works**:
Simply, when you send a request to the API, it forwards it to the GitHub API to check if the specified user exists. If so, a request is sent to retrieve a list of the user's repositories. This response is filtered to remove fork repositories.

> :warning: **Information:**  Due to pagination of GitHub REST API,it is possible to retrieve only 100 repositories/branches at one time. If user that you request have more than 100 repos/branches in repo, API will send another request.

Requests are then sent for the branches of each of these repositories. It is very easy to exceed GitHub's query limit so for the full experience, I recommend using the app for small/medium accounts.

**Example graph without errors:**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
User ->> REST API: GET 'user'
REST API->>GitHub: Req: Does 'user' exist?
GitHub->> REST API: Res: Yes
REST API->>GitHub: GET 'user' repos
GitHub->> REST API: Res: 'user' repos
REST API->>GitHub: GET all repos branches 
GitHub->> REST API: Res: all repos branches
REST API->> User: 'user' account information
```

## Endpoints
`/api/repositories` - **GET** method that will fetch user details from GitHub REST API. (username, repositories, branches). For this endpoint to work you will need to provide valid body and **'Accept'** header. The `application/json`header is required. Otherwise, the application will throw an error.

**Example request:**
```
Method: GET
URL: http://localhost:8080/api/repositories
Headers:
	'Accept': 'application/json'

Body:
{
	"username": "User_login"
}
```

**Example response:**
```json
{
	"login":  "User_login",
	"repositories":  [
		{
			"name":  "Repository name",
			"branches":  [
				{
					"name":  "Branch name",
					"lastCommitSha":  "5ab8572d41a7aee7a004c99bda1a1b807363c9d2"
				}
			]
		}
	]
}
```

For now there is only one endpoint, but application is easily scalable.

## Common problems
1. User Not Found
```json
{
	"status":  404,
	"Message":  "User not found."
}
```
If your answer looks like this, you most likely typed the username incorrectly. Please check again if the name is correct, and if not please get back to me and I will try to help you out.

2. Wrong Header
```json
{
	"status":  406,
	"Message":  "'Accept' header format is not acceptable. Please, provide 'application/json' instead."
}
```
For this kind of exception, you most likely passed the wrong 'Accept' header. Please check if your header is set to `application/json`.

3. Bad Request
```json
{
	"status":  400,
	"error":  "Bad Request"
}
```
You most likely forgot to forward the body to your request. Please check if your body isn't empty.

4. Forbidden
```json
{
	"status":  403,
	"error":  "Forbidden"
}
```
This project does not use any validation so the lock comes from the GitHub API. Most likely your IP was blocked due to a very high number of requests.
